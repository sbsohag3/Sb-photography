        <p>
          Authentication is a process to check if a user is allowed to access
          information or perform a task. If a certified user uses your app, they
          have identified their true identity in a variety of ways, such as
          issuing the correct certificate. <br />
          Authentication will help you find out the true identity of a
          user, it cannot help you control access, which is why we use
          authentication with authentication.
